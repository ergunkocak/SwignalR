# SwignalR

A SignalR client implementation in Swift (port of https://github.com/skerkewitz/SignalR-ObjC).

# Work in progress

The development branch works. But only WebSocket transport is implemented at the moment. Also probably kinda buggy at the moment.

# Dependencies 
- Alamofire 4.3 for HTTP stuff.
- Starscream 2.0.3 for WebSockets.
- CocoaLumberjack/Swift 3.0.0 for loggin.

# Cocoapod

Not yet, sorry.
